    <p>
      ROS-Industrial support for the Staubli tx2-90 (and variants).
    </p>
    <p>
      This package contains configuration data, 3D models and launch files
      for Staubli tx2-90 manipulators. This includes the base model,
      as well as models with extended arm and forearm links.
    </p>
    <p><b>Specifications</b>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>tx2-90 - Standard Arm - Nominal Speed</li>
      <li>tx2-90L - Long Arm - Nominal Speed</li>
      <li>tx2-90XL - Extra Long Arm - Nominal Speed</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Joint limits were taken from broschures, torque limits, and maximum joint velocities
      are based on the
      information in the <em>Staubli Robotics - TX series 90 family -
      Instruction Manual</em> version <em>D28082904C â€“ 01/12/2014</em> and might have changed.
      All urdfs are based on the default motion and joint velocity limits,
      unless noted otherwise (ie: no support for high speed joints, extended /
      limited motion ranges or other options).
    </p>
    <p>
      Before using any of the configuration files and / or meshes included
      in this package, be sure to check they are correct for the particular
      robot model and configuration you intend to use them with.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>NB (1)</b>: Masses, center of mass and moments of inertia were copied from tx-90 package. There they
      were calculated using Solidworks and the official Staubli CAD models, and may not be accurate.
